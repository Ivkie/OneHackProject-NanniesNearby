Nannies Nearby
==================
##More information on DEVPOST
Here is the link to our project to prove we did it on Qoom:

##Inspiration
Parents often find it extremely difficult to find someone to look after their children when they need to work or go out. 
Not only are they trusting the nanny with their children but also with the house. 
Therefore you need someone reputable whilst still living nearby. 
Juggling all these criteria can be a bit of a nightmare but that is where Nannies Nearby comes in!


##What it does
Nannies Nearby requires both parents and babysitters to log in in order to keep the site secure and trustworthy. Once logged in, parents can then access a map which has babysitters pinned in their location. 
If you press on one of those pins you can then access their information e.g. name, location, price per hour, years of experience and a link to their personal profile! 
Their personal profile has a picture of the babysitter and reviews so that the parents can ascertain whether they think they would be suitable to look after their children!


##How we built it
To start we created a mock up of our website using Figma and also developed our colour scheme. 
We then used Qoom as our coding platform as it allowed us to work together collaboratively! In order to actually create the website we coded it using HTML, CSS, JS and JSON.


##Challenges we ran into
As first-time users of Qoom, there were quite a few bugs we had struggled with but we worked through the different options together. 
Time was also another challenge, for it limited how long we could spend on debugging our code and restricted additional features we would have liked to add.


##What's next for Nannies Nearby
We would like to expand Nannies Nearby by creating an app which has a built in messaging function making the process even easier for parents!
